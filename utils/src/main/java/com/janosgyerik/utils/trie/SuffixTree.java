/**
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree
 * The construction of such a tree for the string {\displaystyle S} S
 * takes time and space linear in the length of {\displaystyle S} S.
 * Once constructed, several operations can be performed quickly,
 * for instance locating a substring in {\displaystyle S} S,
 * locating a substring if a certain number of mistakes are allowed,
 * locating matches for a regular expression pattern etc.
 * Suffix trees also provide one of the first linear-time solutions for the longest common substring problem.
 * These speedups come at a cost: storing a string's suffix tree typically requires
 * significantly more space than storing the string itself.
